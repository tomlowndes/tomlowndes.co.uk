              Summer’s the best time of year—no argument here. The days stretch out like lazy cats, and for once, after the 9-to-5 grind, I actually want to do things. The to-do list, though? That bastard only grows. From design projects that live half-finished in my second brain, to house repairs, garden experiments, and the endless pottering that makes a place feel like home—it’s a juggling act. One part therapy, one part chaos.</p>
              <p class="animate">
              But here’s the real win: the paddling pool is up. Cold water, blue sky, sun on my face—sometimes that’s all the reset I need. I’ve carved out pockets of peace in the garden, trying to swap screen time for book time, just me and a paperback, no distractions (well, fewer distractions). I’m trying to read more this summer—not for productivity points, just because it feels good to slow down and actually be somewhere.</p>

            A Quiet Realization
          </h5>
          <article>
            <p>After a few long, honest conversations with my partner—the kind that peel back the polite version of yourself—I started seeing a few patterns in my life that were hard to ignore. The overwhelm. The way my brain latches onto certain details while completely missing others. The frustration of trying to explain how exhausting it is just to keep up sometimes.</p>

            <p>I finally made an appointment with my GP. That kicked off a journey I’m still on. I’ve since been diagnosed with autism—which brought a strange mix of relief and reflection. It explained so much about how I move through the world, how I communicate, how I process everything. And while that diagnosis gave me some clarity, I’m still on the waiting list for an ADHD assessment—a diagnosis that feels highly likely, if not inevitable.</p>

            <p>Thankfully, after a helpful conversation with a mental health nurse, I was told about the “Right to Choose” scheme. I took the option, hoping to shave years off the process. Because something had to give.</p>

            <p>This isn’t about labelling myself—it’s about understanding how to navigate the world in a way that actually works for me.</p>

            Home Assistant and Proxmox
            </h5>  
            <p>I’ve been keeping busy with side projects that spark joy and curiosity. Making my house smarter with Home Assistant and Proxmox has become a bit of an obsession—I’m geeking out over automations that actually make life easier. Then there’s the 3D printer I got for Christmas, which is slowly becoming my new favourite toy. From printing useful household gadgets to experimenting with little art pieces, it’s a creative playground that’s both challenging and fun.</p>
            
            <p>And while all this tech keeps my mind busy, I’ve also been trying to declutter my physical space. After binge-watching videos from Never Too Small, I’m inspired to clear out the clutter and live a bit lighter. Organizing everything I own feels like a project in itself, but it’s also strangely freeing. Less stuff, less noise, more room to breathe.

            <p>Kitchen Confidential by Anthony Bourdain</p>

            <p>Right now, I’m diving into Kitchen Confidential by Anthony Bourdain—the raw, unfiltered memoir of a chef who lived hard, cooked harder, and saw the underbelly of the restaurant world like no one else. Bourdain’s voice hits that sweet spot between brutal honesty and dark humor, the kind that makes you nod along and squirm at the same time.</p>

            <p>His stories aren’t just about food; they’re about life on the edge, the chaos behind the scenes, and the relentless pursuit of something real in a world full of smoke and mirrors. For me, reading Bourdain is like a shot of caffeine for the creative soul—a reminder that passion doesn’t come neat and tidy, and sometimes, the best work happens in the mess.</p>

            <p>It’s pushed me to embrace the chaos in my own creative process—to stop waiting for perfect conditions or the “right mood” to strike, and just get my hands dirty. Whether it’s tackling a tricky design project or figuring out new automations at home, Bourdain’s grit reminds me that the grind, the mistakes, and the late nights are all part of the journey.</p>
            
            <p>So, if you find yourself stuck or searching for motivation, Kitchen Confidential is a sharp kick in the pants—and exactly the kind of fuel I need right now.
