              Winter is not my favourite time of the year. The days are getting shorter, the nights are getting darker and my motivation after work seems to dwindle to a griding hault. 
              My list of jobs on the other hand never seems to dwindle, to personal design projects to pottering around my house and garden.</p>
            <p class="animate">
              Recently after a few long discussions with my partner, It was apparent that some of my problems in life may be caused by ADHD and/or Autism. So i made an appointment with 
              the doctors and boy when they say metal health is a long wait (4 years in my area) they where not lying. But after a helpfull conversation with a mental health nurse, I have used
              "my right to choose" to hopefully get this wait down to a few months.

              In a few weeks time it will be christmas and then 2025, during this time I will enjoy the company of friends and family and a few cheeky drinks.

              Life's good.

            <p>Geeking out over whole house automations</a></p>
            <p>
              I started off my journey several years ago in home automation. I had a few light bulbs and sockets that could be tuned on and off with Alexa. 
              From there it has grown and grow, not only can I control many of my lights, lamps and sockets (for the important items in my house.)               
            </p>
            <p>  
              I can set automation based on time location and even presence of a person in that specific room, which for now is my office and led strip behind my desk 
              is illuminated between 8am â€“ 10pm and power to my lamp is provided. If no presence is detected it will then turn off after a minute.
