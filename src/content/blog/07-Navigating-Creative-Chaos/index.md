I’m a creative designer, and I also navigate the world with both ADHD and autism. It’s a fantastic combo—like having a high-speed processor with a dozen tabs open at all times. It gives me a unique way of seeing design, noticing details others might miss, and making unexpected creative connections. But let’s be real: it can also make projects feel like trying to herd cats.

If you’re in the same boat, you know the struggle. One minute, you’re laser-focused, completely immersed in a design. The next, you’re deep-diving into a random Wikipedia rabbit hole about medieval typography. The ability to hyper-focus is a gift—until it isn’t. And deadlines? They’re more like… suggestions, right?

So, how do we harness this creative chaos without getting lost in the weeds? How do we actually *finish* a project—design or otherwise—instead of getting distracted by 15 new ones?

Over the years, I’ve tested different strategies—some worked, some flopped spectacularly. Here’s one that’s stuck: **The Solo Navigator System.**

### **The Solo Navigator System**
*(A mash-up of brutal focus, external accountability, and just enough structure to keep you from imploding.)*

Some productivity systems feel like they were built for robots, not creative humans with a brain that runs on high-octane chaos. The Solo Navigator System is for those of us who need *just enough* structure to avoid spiraling, but not so much that we feel trapped in an endless cycle of checklists and corporate nonsense.

Here’s how it works:

#### **1. One Mission at a Time (Because Multitasking is a Lie)**
- Close the 27 tabs. Silence the phone. Pick *one* task at a time. Whether it’s designing, writing, problem-solving, or planning your next adventure, stay in the moment.
- If another idea pops into your head (because of course it will), dump it in a “Later” list. Get back to work.

#### **2. Checkpoints Instead of Checklists**
- Instead of endless to-do lists that feel like a slow death, use “Checkpoints.” Think: major progress markers instead of tiny steps.
- Example: Instead of “Find reference images” → “Sketch first draft” → “Choose color scheme,” just set one Checkpoint: “Rough Draft Complete.” That’s it.
- Once you hit a Checkpoint, do a quick self-check: Is the project still on track? Are you stuck? If so, *fix it now*, before the details pile up.

#### **3. External Reality Checks (Because Left Alone, You’ll Redesign the Whole Damn Thing)**
- Have a *human* check in with you. Not a project management app. An actual person—colleague, friend, accountability buddy—who makes sure you haven’t abandoned ship.
- This doesn’t have to be a formal meeting. A quick “Hey, still working on this?” can snap you out of a perfectionist spiral.

### **Expanding Beyond Work: A Lifestyle System**
ADHD and autism don’t clock out at 5 PM. The same strategies that keep design projects on track can apply to everything—managing your day, planning meals, staying on top of health, and even remembering to relax (because yes, that needs structure too).

#### **4. The Second Brain: Offload the Mental Clutter**
- Your brain wasn’t built to store everything—it was built to think. Use Obsidian (or any note-taking system) as your **Second Brain.**
- Create daily notes for thoughts, reminders, and ideas. Use tags to quickly find what you need. Offloading information keeps your mind clear for actual thinking, not just remembering.

#### **5. The Daily Journal: A Mental Reset Button**
- Every morning or night, do a quick brain dump. What went well? What’s on your mind? What’s the top priority for tomorrow?
- Use this time to reflect, course-correct, and refine your approach to work and life.

This system works because it embraces how we function: chaotic, creative, but in need of guardrails to keep us from drifting into the abyss.

**Final Thought:**
Deadlines aren’t the enemy. Over-planning is. The trick is finding the sweet spot between structure and flexibility—enough to keep you moving, but not so much that it sucks the fun out of creating. Try it. Tweak it. Make it your own. Just don’t get lost in the details.

Because the best work isn’t the one that’s *almost* finished—it’s the one that actually sees the light of day.
