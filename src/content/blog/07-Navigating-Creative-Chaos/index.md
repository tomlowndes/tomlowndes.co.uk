# Navigating Creative Chaos: A Framework for Design Projects When You're Neurodivergent

As many of you know, I'm a creative designer, and I'm also someone who navigates the world with both ADHD and autism. It’s a fantastic combo – in the sense that it provides a unique lens through which I approach design, but also, let’s be honest, it can make projects feel like trying to herd cats sometimes.

If you’re in the same boat, you’ll understand the struggle. The bursts of intense focus, the sudden shifts in interest, the hyper-awareness of details – all these wonderful aspects of our neurodivergence can be both superpowers and… well, challenges, when it comes to sticking to a project and getting it done.

So, how do we harness our creative energy without getting lost in the weeds? How do we actually *finish* a design project?

Over the years, I've experimented with different approaches, and I've finally landed on a framework that works pretty well for me. I’m sharing it today in the hopes that it can be helpful for others who think and create a bit differently. 

**My Framework: The "S-P-A-C-E" System**

I call it the S-P-A-C-E system, and it breaks down like this:

*   **S - Scope & Structure:**
    *   **Define the Goal:** What are you trying to achieve with this design? Be clear. It might seem obvious, but it's essential. Write it down.
    *   **Set Boundaries:** This is HUGE for us. What are the essential elements? What’s out of scope? Knowing what NOT to do is just as important.
    *   **Break it Down:** Large projects are terrifying. Break them into smaller, manageable tasks. I like to use a digital to-do list, but you could use index cards, a whiteboard, anything!
    *   **Rough Timeline:** I'm not talking about rigid deadlines (ugh!). Instead, try to give a rough estimation of the time for each task. This helps maintain momentum.

*   **P - Preparation & Planning:**
    *   **Gather Inspiration:** Mood boards, reference images, competitor analysis – collect your data. The key is to have it all in one place.
    *   **Mind Map or Brain Dump:** Let your ideas flow! This is about getting everything out of your head. No judgment.
    *   **Organize Your Tools:** Ensure your workspace (whether digital or physical) is set up. This reduces distractions and anxiety about finding your tools mid-flow.

*   **A - Action & Application:**
    *   **Start With The Smallest Step:** Don't try to conquer the whole project at once. Focus on one tiny piece. This combats overwhelm.
    *   **Batch Similar Tasks:** When you're in the right mindset, tackle several tasks of the same type (e.g., color palettes, icon creation, layout, etc.). This can help you stay in the zone.
    *   **Time Blocking (Loosely):** I try to focus on one task within a block of time. This isn’t rigid like a neurotypical scheduler. It’s more about having a guideline. A pomodoro timer is my best friend for this!

*   **C - Checkpoints & Course Correction:**
    *   **Regular Breaks:** Don't burn out. Step away from the design. Do something different. Come back with fresh eyes.
    *   **Progress Review:** Is your design on track with your initial scope? Are you overcomplicating things? Be honest with yourself.
    *   **Adapt and Adjust:** It’s okay if things change. Review your timeline, adjust the scope if necessary. Don't be afraid to pivot.

*   **E - Evaluate & Expand:**
    *   **Final Review:** Is it complete? Does it meet the initial goal you set? Check over everything before signing off.
    *   **Reflect & Learn:** What worked well? What didn’t? Take note of your process so you can refine it for next time.
    *   **Share & Celebrate:** Once it’s done, be proud! Share your creation with the world! Or at least with your close friends and colleagues.

**Why This Framework Works (For Me):**

This system isn't about rigid rules; it's about creating a structure that supports my unique way of working. It's about:

*   **Reducing Overwhelm:** Breaking down projects into smaller chunks.
*   **Harnessing Hyperfocus:** Grouping similar tasks to stay in the zone.
*   **Managing Impulsivity:** Having a plan before diving in.
*   **Embracing Flexibility:** Knowing that it's okay to change direction if needed.

**Your Turn!**

This is just what works for *me*, and everyone’s different! I encourage you to experiment and find the systems that best support your creative flow.

Do you have any tips or frameworks that help you manage design projects as a neurodivergent creator?
