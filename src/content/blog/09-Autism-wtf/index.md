# Diagnosed at 34: Autism, Maybe ADHD, and Finally Making Sense of Things

For most of my life, I thought I was just bad at “life stuff.”

I struggled with routines, social interactions were often confusing, and I couldn’t understand why certain environments drained me so much faster than they seemed to affect others. I’d either hyper-focus for hours or get completely overwhelmed trying to start the simplest task. I chalked it up to personality quirks, burnout, or just being “not great” at adulting.

But at 34, after years of quietly wondering if something deeper was going on, I was diagnosed with autism. Now, I’m also exploring the possibility of ADHD.

And honestly? Things finally make a bit more sense.

## What Made Me Look Into It

Like many late-diagnosed adults, it started with a quiet pattern of realisation.

It wasn’t one moment — more like a series of smaller ones:
- Watching videos or reading posts where people described their own late diagnoses and feeling *weirdly seen*.
- Noticing that I processed things differently in social settings or at work — not worse, just different.
- Realising how much mental energy I spent masking, planning, and managing sensory overload.

But the real tipping point? Repeated arguments with my partner.

I didn’t always understand her emotions, or why she reacted to things the way she did. And from her side, it probably felt like I was cold or distant — when really, I just didn’t know how to read the situation. I wanted to do better, to connect more deeply, and that’s when I started asking myself some hard questions.

Eventually, I decided to dig deeper. What I thought would be a short detour turned into a complete reframing of how I saw myself.

## Getting Diagnosed as an Adult

I won't lie — it was a strange, emotional process.

At 34, you don’t expect to hear something that completely redefines how you think about your past. Suddenly, childhood habits made more sense. So did all the awkwardness I couldn’t explain at school, in jobs, in friendships.

There was relief, yes. But also a kind of quiet grief — for not knowing sooner, for trying to force myself to function like everyone else for decades.

## So, What’s Changed?

Not everything. But enough to matter.

I’ve started to rethink how I approach work, rest, and relationships. I’m learning to:
- Build systems that work *with* my brain, not against it.
- Be more intentional about sensory input (lighting, noise, environment).
- Accept that some things take more effort — and that’s okay.

I still forget stuff. I still lose focus. And I still fall into rabbit holes. But now I know *why* — and that knowledge helps me be a little kinder to myself.

## Autism and Maybe ADHD: A Complex Mix

While autism brought clarity, ADHD adds a bit more uncertainty. The two often overlap, and the symptoms can blur into each other. For now, I’m exploring it — noticing the traits, reading, journaling, and talking to others.

It’s messy. But in a good way. Like finally having the right map, even if you’re still figuring out the terrain.

## Why I’m Sharing This

I’m not writing this to be inspirational. I’m writing it because I wish I’d seen more stories like this when I was searching.

Getting diagnosed late doesn’t solve everything — but it gives you a language for things you’ve felt your whole life.

If any of this resonates, maybe it’s worth exploring further. And if you’re someone supporting a friend or partner through a similar process, just listening — without fixing — means more than you think.

## A Few Things That Helped Me

- **Keeping a private journal** to notice patterns in energy, focus, and stress.
- **Using Obsidian** to structure my thoughts in a way that feels less chaotic.
- **Noise-cancelling headphones**, for those days when the world is just *too much*.
- **Community** — even if it’s just a Reddit thread or a podcast that makes you feel less alone.
