## Building a new corporate website

![Dove Website](/astro-sphere.jpg)

In the last year, I've had the amazing opportunity to develop the new corporate website for Dove Technology. This extensive project allowed me to explore various aspects of web development and design, culminating in a website that is easy to use and navigate. Using a combination of WordPress and Elementor Pro, we crafted a website that not only meets the company needs, but has driven an uptake in visits and conversions.

**Design:** The visual aspects were thoughtfully designed to reflect Dove Technology's brand identity. The sleek, modern design highlights the company's advanced solutions, creating an appealing and professional online image.

**Coding:** Utilizing Wordpess and Elementor, I developed a strong and responsive website that is optimized for performance across all devices. This ensures a smooth and consistent experience for users, whether they're viewing the site on a computer, tablet, or phone.

**Product Photography:** Top-notch product images were taken to showcase Dove Technology's products in the best light.

**Video Content:** Engaging and informative videos were created to provide visitors with a dynamic way to learn more about Dove Technology's products and services. These videos introduce an interactive element to the website, making the information more accessible and engaging.

This project has a good learning experiance and I'm proud of the outcome.
